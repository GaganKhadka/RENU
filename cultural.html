            <h2>Why Culture Matters in Early Childhood</h2>
            <p>
                Every child comes from a unique cultural background that shapes how they see the world, how they communicate and how they learn.
                Culture includes language, traditions, beliefs, celebrations, values and family stories. It also includes the everyday ways families care for one another and make meaning from their experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                When children see their cultures respected and reflected in their learning environment, they feel a stronger sense of identity and belonging.
                Being recognised for who they are helps them develop confidence, curiosity and pride.

    <h2>What Children May Experience in Diverse Settings</h2>
    <p>
        Children from culturally diverse families may face challenges such as language barriers, feeling different or moving between two or more cultures at once.
        Some children may experience racism or microaggressions, even in early childhood, which can affect their confidence and relationships.
    </p>
    <p>
        Children who speak more than one language often move between languages at home and in the centre. This is a natural part of bilingual development.
        Supporting their home language helps them stay connected to family and strengthens their overall learning.
    </p>
    <p>
        For First Nations children, cultural identity is deeply tied to land, community and kinship. Many families carry the ongoing impacts of colonisation and discrimination.
        Creating culturally safe environments is essential so that every child feels respected and understood.

            <h2>How Educators Support Cultural Identity and Inclusion</h2>

                <li>Respecting cultural traditions, values and family practices.</li>
                <li>Building strong, trusting relationships with families as cultural partners.</li>
                <li>Reflecting on our own cultural assumptions and avoiding stereotypes.</li>
                <li>Working with local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations.</li>
                <li>Creating safe spaces for conversations about difference and belonging.</li>
            </ul>
